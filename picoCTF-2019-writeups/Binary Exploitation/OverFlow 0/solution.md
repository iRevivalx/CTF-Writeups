# Question
This should be easy. Overflow the correct buffer in this program and get a flag. Its also found in /problems/overflow-0_3_dc6e55b8358f1c82f03ddd018a5549e0 on the shell server. Source.

# Hint
Find a way to trigger the flag to print
If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.

# Solution
This challenge tested our buffer overflow knowledge. Therefore, we will get the flag by entering many characters and exceeding the buffer size.
