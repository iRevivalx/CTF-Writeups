# Question
The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as logon and find what they've been looking at? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/47307/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:47307

# Hint 
Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for {{name}}'s?


# Solution
By trying out any username and password, you are still able to login. You will be greeted by a message.

When inspecting the cookies, it can be seen that there is an cookie name admin with a False value.

Hence, by changing the value of admin to True will result in the printing of the flag.
